# Programming Projects
This folder contains several programming projects to help you learn about each of the basic phases of compilation.
* Parsing in [PA2](./PA2/README.md)
* Pretty Printing while parsing in [PA3](./PA3/README.md)
* Building an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) in [PA4/PA4a](./PA4/PA4a.md)
* Pretty Printing from an AST in [PA4/PA4b](./PA4/PA4b.md)
* Generating a Symbol Table from an AST in [PA4/PA4c](./PA4/PA4c.md)
* Type Checking a program from an AST in [PA4/PA4d](./PA4/PA4d.md)

In each case, you are given a solution for the [MiniC language](./MiniCvsMiniJava.md) and
asked to generate a solution for MiniJava, which is essentially a super set of MiniC containing
classes and integer arrays.
